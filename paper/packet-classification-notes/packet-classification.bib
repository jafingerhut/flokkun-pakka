Given an n-point set P in the plane, build a data structure so that, given a query triangle R, the number of points of P lying in R can be determined quickly. Similar questions can be asked for point sets in higher dimensions, with triangles replaced by simplices or by more complicated shapes. Algorithms of this type are of crucial importance in computational geometry, as they can be used as subroutines in solutions to many seemingly unrelated problems, which are often motivated by practical applications, for instance in computer graphics (ray tracing, hidden-surface removal etc.). We present a survey of theoretical results and the main techniques in geometric range  searching.},

In this framework, the forwarding database of a router consists of a potentially large number of filters on key header fields.

abstract = {Routers must perform packet classification at high speeds to efficiently implement functions such as firewalls and QoS routing. Packet classification requires matching each packet against a database of filters (or rules), and forwarding the packet according to the highest priority filter. Existing filter schemes with fast lookup time do not scale to large filter databases. Other more scalable schemes work for 2-dimensional filters, but their lookup times degrade quickly with each additional dimension. While there exist good hardware solutions, our new schemes are geared towards software implementation.We introduce a generic packet classification algorithm, called Tuple Space Search (TSS). Because real databases typically use only a small number of distinct field lengths, by mapping filters to tuples even a simple linear search of the tuple space can provide significant speedup over naive linear search over the filters. Each tuple is maintained as a hash table that can be searched in one memory access. We then introduce techniques for further refining the search of the tuple space, and demonstrate their effectiveness on some firewall databases. For example, a real database of 278 filters had a tuple space of 41 which our algorithm prunes to 11 tuples. Even as we increased the filter database size from 1K to 100K (using a random two-dimensional filter generation model), the number of tuples grew from 53 to only 186, and the pruned tuples only grew from 1 to 4. Our Pruned Tuple Space search is also the only scheme known to us that allows fast updates and fast search times. We also show a lower bound on the general tuple space search problem, and describe an optimal algorithm, called Rectangle Search, for two-dimensional filters.},

abstract = {Routers classify packets to determine which flow they belong to, and to decide what service they should receive. Classification may, in general, be based on an arbitrary number of fields in the packet header. Performing classification quickly on an arbitrary number of fields is known to be difficult, and has poor worst-case performance. In this paper, we consider a number of classifiers taken from real networks. We find that the classifiers contain considerable structure and redundancy that can be exploited by the classification algorithm. In particular, we find that a simple multi-stage classification algorithm, called RFC (recursive flow classification), can classify 30 million packets per second in pipelined hardware, or one million packets per second in software.},

Unlike HiCuts, however, in which each node in the decision tree represents a hyperplane, each node in the HyperCuts decision tree represents a k--dimensional hypercube. Using this extra degree of freedom and a new set of heuristics to find optimal hypercubes for a given amount of storage, HyperCuts can provide an order of magnitude improvement over existing classification algorithms. HyperCuts uses 2 to 10 times less memory than HiCuts optimized for memory, while the worst case search time of HyperCuts is 50--500\% better than that of HiCuts optimized for speed. Compared with another recent scheme, EGT-PC, HyperCuts uses 1.8--7 times less memory space while the worst case search time is up to 5 times smaller. More importantly, unlike EGT-PC, HyperCuts can be fully pipelined to provide one classification result every packet arrival time, and also allows fast updates.},

abstract = {Packet classification is an enabling function for a variety of Internet applications including quality of service, security, monitoring, and multimedia communications. In order to classify a packet as belonging to a particular flow or set of flows, network nodes must perform a search over a set of filters using multiple fields of the packet as the search key. In general, there have been two major threads of research addressing packet classification, algorithmic and architectural. A few pioneering groups of researchers posed the problem, provided complexity bounds, and offered a collection of algorithmic solutions. Subsequently, the design space has been vigorously explored by many offering new algorithms and improvements on existing algorithms. Given the inability of early algorithms to meet performance constraints imposed by high speed links, researchers in industry and academia devised architectural solutions to the problem. This thread of research produced the most widely-used packet classification device technology, Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM). New architectural research combines intelligent algorithms and novel architectures to eliminate many of the unfavorable characteristics of current TCAMs. We observe that the community appears to be converging on a combined algorithmic and architectural approach to the problem. Using a taxonomy based on the high-level approach to the problem and a minimal set of running examples, we provide a survey of the seminal and recent solutions to the problem. It is our hope to foster a deeper understanding of the various packet classification techniques while providing a useful framework for discerning relationships and distinctions.},

abstract = {Internet address lookup is a challenging problem because of increasing routing table sizes, increased traffic, higher speed links, and the migration to 128 bit IPv6 addresses. IP routing lookup requires computing the best matching prefix, for which standard solutions like hashing were believed to be inapplicable. The best existing solution we know of, BSD radix tries, scales badly as IP moves to 128 bit addresses. Our paper describes a new algorithm for best matching prefix using binary search on hash tables organized by prefix lengths. Our scheme scales very well as address and routing table sizes increase: independent of the table size, it requires a worst case time of log2(address bits) hash lookups. Thus only 5 hash lookups are needed for IPv4 and 7 for IPv6. We also introduce Mutating Binary Search and other optimizations that, for a typical IPv4 backbone router with over 33,000 entries, considerably reduce the average number of hashes to less than 2, of which one hash can be simplified to an indexed array access. We expect similar average case behavior for IPv6.},

abstract = {The ability to provide differentiated services to users with widely varying requirements is becoming increasingly important, and Internet Service Providers would like to provide these differentiated services using the same shared network infrastructure. The key mechanism, that enables differentiation in a connectionless network, is the packet classification function that parses the headers of the packets, and after determining their context, classifies them based on administrative policies or real-time reservation decisions. Packet classification, however, is a complex operation that can become the bottleneck in routers that try to support gigabit link capacities. Hence, many proposals for differentiated services only require classification at lower speed edge routers and also avoid classification based on multiple fields in the packet header even if it might be advantageous to service providers. In this paper, we present new packet classification schemes that, with a worst-case and traffic-independent performance metric, can classify packets, by checking amongst a few thousand filtering rules, at rates of a million packets per second using range matches on more than 4 packet header fields. For a special case of classification in two dimensions, we present an algorithm that can handle more than 128K rules at these speeds in a traffic independent manner. We emphasize worst-case performance over average case performance because providing differentiated services requires intelligent queueing and scheduling of packets that precludes any significant queueing before the differentiating step (i.e., before packet classification). The presented filtering or classification schemes can be used to classify packets for security policy enforcement, applying resource management decisions, flow identification for RSVP reservations, multicast look-ups, and for source-destination and policy based routing. The scalability and performance of the algorithms have been demonstrated by implementation and testing in a prototype system.},

abstract = {Packet classification is important for applications such as firewalls, intrusion detection, and differentiated services. Existing algorithms for packet classification reported in the literature scale poorly in either time or space as filter databases grow in size. Hardware solutions such as TCAMs do not scale to large classifiers. However, even for large classifiers (say 100,000 rules), any packet is likely to match a few (say 10) rules. Our paper seeks to exploit this observation to produce a scalable packet classification scheme called Aggregated Bit Vector (ABV). Our paper takes the bit vector search algorithm (BV) described in [11] (which takes linear time) and adds two new ideas, recursive aggregation of bit maps and filter rearrangement, to create ABV (which can take logarithmic time for many databases). We show that ABV outperforms BV by an order of magnitude using simulations on both industrial firewall databases and synthetically generated databases.},

abstract = {Traffic classification in the Internet is a crucial mechanism necessary to support network services. Using Ternary Content-Addressable Memories (TCAMs) to perform high-speed packet classification has become the de facto standard in industry. TCAMs concurrently match the packet headers against the rules in a classification database providing high throughput unparalleled by software-based solutions. The complexity of packet classification policies has been growing rapidly as the number of Internet services continues to increase. Many complex classification policies are naturally represented in a hierarchical fashion, where different layers perform classification based on the administrative domain and the traffic QoS parameters. However, multiple levels of classification hierarchy incur high lookup latency while high TCAM memory requirements of flattened classification policies is a major issue since TCAMs have very limited capacity. In this paper we focus on the fundamental tradeoff between the TCAM space and the number of lookups in the TCAM classification policies. We consider two optimization problems of dual nature: the first problem is to minimize the number of TCAM entries subject to the constraint on the maximum number of levels in the policy hierarchy; the second problem is to minimize the number of levels in the policy hierarchy subject to the constraint on the maximum number of TCAM entries. We propose efficient algorithms for these problems, which do not require any hardware changes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study these problems. We also show experimental results that support our findings.}

abstract = {Ternary content-addressable memories (TCAMs) have gained wide acceptance in the industry for storing and searching Access Control Lists (ACLs). In this paper, we propose algorithms for addressing two important problems that are encountered while using TCAMs: reducing range expansion and multi-match classification.Our first algorithm addresses the problem of expansion of rules with range fields to represent range rules in TCAMs, a single range rule is mapped to multiple TCAM entries, which reduces the utilization of TCAMs. We propose a new scheme called Database Independent Range PreEncoding (DIRPE) that, in comparison to earlier approaches, reduces the worst-case number of TCAM entries a single rule maps on to. DIRPE works without prior knowledge of the database, scales when a large number of ranges is present, and has good incremental update properties.Our second algorithm addresses the problem of finding multiple matches in a TCAM. When searched, TCAMs return the first matching entry; however, new applications require either the first few or all matching entries. We describe a novel algorithm, called Multi-match Using Discriminators (MUD), that finds multiple matches without storing any per-search state information in the TCAM, thus making it suitable for multi-threaded environments. MUD does not increase the number of TCAM entries needed, and hence scales to large databases.Our algorithms do not require any modifications to existing TCAMs and are hence relatively easy to deploy. We evaluate the algorithms using real-life and random databases.},

abstract = {Packet classification is inherently a multi dimensional search problem which is either very computation intensive or memory intensive for software implementation. Thus, hardware based solution is necessary to keep up with gigabit line rate processing. In this paper, we consider using standard Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) as a hardware classification engine. Traditionally, this approach has been deemed inefficient because ranges have tobe broken into prefixes before stored in TCAM, resulting in large expansion. We propose a novel scheme where we can efficiently map ranges into TCAM. Our proposal has no expansion at all, or very little expansion for width constrained application. Our proposal enables high speed deterministic classification using low cost commodity hardware.},

abstract = {Packet Classification is the enabling function performed in commodity switches for providing various services such as access control, intrusion detection, load balancing, and so on. Ternary Content Addressable Memories (TCAMs) are the de facto standard for performing packet classification at high speeds. However, TCAMs are highly costlier both in terms of cost and power consumption, forcing the switch vendors towards placing lots of effort for power management. Hence, power-efficient solutions for TCAM-based packet classification are highly relevant even today. In this article, we propose a novel rule placement algorithm based on the unique field values’ presence within the rule databases. We evaluate the total search that is needed to be inspected with respect to the traditional placement approach and the proposed placement approach based on the information content within the fields. Simulation results showed an average reduction of 30.55\% in the search space by the proposed placement approach, thereby resulting in an average reduction of 18.85\% per search energy over TCAM. With typical TCAM clock speeds ranging between 200--400MHz, this reduction in the per-search energy maps to a huge reduction in the total energy consumed by the TCAM-based network switches. The proposed solution is plug-and-play type requiring only minimal pre-processing within the Network Processing Unit (NPU) of the switches and edge routers.},

abstract = {We use a collection of hash tables to represent a multidimensional packet classification table. These hash tables are derived from a trie-representation of the multidimensional classifier. The height of this trie is O(W), where W is the sum of the maximum possible length, in bits, of each of the fields of a filter. The leaves at level i of the trie together with markers for some of the leaves at levels j such that j > i are stored in a hash table Hi. The placement of markers is such that a binary search of the Hi's successfully locates the highest-priority filter that matches any given packet. The number of hash tables equals the trie height, O(W). Hence, a packet may be classified by performing O(log W) hash-table lookups. So the expected lookup-complexity of our data structure for multidimensional packet classification is O(log W). Our proposed scheme affords a memory advantage over the O(log W) 1-D scheme of Waldvogel et al. For multidimensional packet classification, our proposed scheme provides both a time and memory advantage over the extended grid-of-tries scheme of Baboescu et al.},

This categorization may make information accessible for quality of service or security handling on the network. To make packet classification both fast and scalable, we propose a new algorithm that combines cross-producting with linear search. The new algorithm, Controlled Cross-producting, could improve the scalability of cross-producting significantly with respect to storage, while maintaining the search latency. In addition, we introduce several refinements and procedures for incremental update. We evaluate the performance of our scheme with filter databases of varying sizes and characteristics. Specifically, we experimented with 12 different types of filter databases, whose sizes vary from 16K to 128K. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and scalability of our scheme. A comparison with the prominent existing schemes further indicates that the proposed scheme takes less time and space.}

abstract = {Packet Classification is a key functionality provided by modern routers. Previous decision-tree algorithms, HiCuts and HyperCuts, cut the multi-dimensional rule space to separate a classifier's rules. Despite their optimizations, the algorithms incur considerable memory overhead due to two issues: (1) Many rules in a classifier overlap and the overlapping rules vary vastly in size, causing the algorithms' fine cuts for separating the small rules to replicate the large rules. (2) Because a classifier's rule-space density varies significantly, the algorithms' equi-sized cuts for separating the dense parts needlessly partition the sparse parts, resulting in many ineffectual nodes that hold only a few rules. We propose EffiCuts which employs four novel ideas: (1) Separable trees: To eliminate overlap among small and large rules, we separate all small and large rules. We define a subset of rules to be separable if all the rules are either small or large in each dimension. We build a distinct tree for each such subset where each dimension can be cut coarsely to separate the large rules, or finely to separate the small rules without incurring replication. (2) Selective tree merging: To reduce the multiple trees' extra accesses which degrade throughput, we selectively merge separable trees mixing rules that may be small or large in at most one dimension. (3) Equi-dense cuts: We employ unequal cuts which distribute a node's rules evenly among the children, avoiding ineffectual nodes at the cost of a small processing overhead in the tree traversal. (4) Node Co-location: To achieve fewer accesses per node than HiCuts and HyperCuts, we co-locate parts of a node and its children. Using ClassBench, we show that for similar throughput EffiCuts needs factors of 57 less memory than HyperCuts and of 4-8 less power than TCAM.},

Because of inherent difficulties, many of these solutions scale poorly in either time or space as rule sets grow in size. Recursive Flow Classification (RFC) is an algorithm with a very high classifying speed. However, its preprocessing complexity and memory requirement are rather high. In this paper, we propose an enhanced RFC (ERFC) algorithm, in which a hash-based aggregated bit vector scheme is exploited to speed up its preprocessing procedure. A compressed and cacheable data structure is also introduced to decrease total memory requirement and improve its searching performance. Evaluation results show that ERFC provides a great improvement over RFC in both space requirement and preprocessing time. The search time complexity of ERFC is equivalent to that of RFC in the worst case; and its average classifying speed is improved by about 100\%.},

abstract = {Efficient packet classification is a core concern for network services. Traditional multi-field classification approaches, in both software and ternary content-addressable memory (TCAMs), entail tradeoffs between (memory) space and (lookup) time. TCAMs cannot efficiently represent range rules, a common class of classification rules confining values of packet fields to given ranges. The exponential space growth of TCAM entries relative to the number of fields is exacerbated when multiple fields contain ranges. In this work, we present a novel approach which identifies properties of many classifiers which can be implemented in linear space and with worst-case guaranteed logarithmic time emph{and} allows the addition of more fields including range constraints without impacting space and time complexities. On real-life classifiers from Cisco Systems and additional classifiers from ClassBench (with real parameters), 90-95\% of rules are thus handled, and the other 5-10\% of rules can be stored in TCAM to be processed in parallel.},

To keep up with this, a never-stopping research has been transforming the Internet ecosystem over the time. Technological changes on both protocols (the uptake of IPv6) and network architectures (the adoption of Software Defined Networking) introduced new challenges for ASIC designers. In particular, IPv6 and OpenFlow increased the complexity of the rule matching problem, pushing researchers to build new packet classification algorithms capable to keep pace with a steady growth of link speed.A lot of research effort identifies better lookup techniques capitalizing on the characteristics of rule sets. So far, the availability of small numbers of real rule sets and synthetic ones, generated with tools such as ClassBench, has boosted research in the IPv4 world. Starting from an analysis of rule sets taken from operational environments, we present ClassBench-ng, a new open source tool for the generation of synthetic IPv4, IPv6, and OpenFlow 1.0 rule sets exposing the same properties of real ones. We feel this tool can meet the requirements of nowadays researchers, boosting the rule matching research as ClassBench has done since ten years ago.},

As the state-of-the-art of software packet classification, decision-tree algorithms employ various geometrical cutting schemes to build optimized decision trees. However, existing cutting schemes cannot meet the desired performance on large rulesets because they sacrifice either classification speed or memory size by design. In this paper, we reveal the inefficiencies of current cutting schemes — equi-sized cutting and equi-dense cutting — and propose a new cutting scheme and its corresponding decision-tree algorithm, named “BitCuts”. BitCuts achieves only 42\%–59\% the memory accesses of HyperSplit, HyperCuts and EffiCuts, the typical decision-tree algorithms. In addition, BitCuts accelerates child-node indexing with bit-manipulation instructions, enabling fast tree traversal. A DPDK-based evaluation on the ACL10K ruleset shows that BitCuts achieves 2.0x – 2.2x the throughput of HyperSplit, HyperCuts and EffiCuts. Furthermore, BitCuts is the only algorithm that achieves 10 Gbps throughput with 3 cores. The memory consumption of BitCuts is only 12\% of HyperCuts, 19\% of EffiCuts, and is comparable to that of HyperSplit, which proves that BitCuts outperforms existing algorithms in achieving a good trade-off between speed and space.}

abstract = {Packet classification is a fundamental problem in computer networking. This problem exposes a hard tradeoff between the computation and state complexity, which makes it particularly challenging. To navigate this tradeoff, existing solutions rely on complex hand-tuned heuristics, which are brittle and hard to optimize.In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (RL) approach to solve the packet classification problem. There are several characteristics that make this problem a good fit for Deep RL. First, many existing solutions iteratively build a decision tree by splitting nodes in the tree. Second, the effects of these actions (e.g., splitting nodes) can only be evaluated once the entire tree is built. These two characteristics are naturally captured by the ability of RL to take actions that have sparse and delayed rewards. Third, it is computationally efficient to generate data traces and evaluate decision trees, which alleviate the notoriously high sample complexity problem of Deep RL algorithms. Our solution, NeuroCuts, uses succinct representations to encode state and action space, and efficiently explore candidate decision trees to optimize for a global objective. It produces compact decision trees optimized for a specific set of rules and a given performance metric, such as classification time, memory footprint, or a combination of the two. Evaluation on Class-Bench shows that NeuroCuts outperforms existing hand-crafted algorithms in classification time by 18\% at the median, and reduces both classification time and memory footprint by up to 3X.},

A challenging problem in this regard is to use an algorithm that can classify packets at a high speed and with a reasonably low memory consumption.

We propose MBitCuts as a novel solution that reduces both memory usage and memory access in this algorithm by changing the method of bit selection in the cutting of the geometric subspace model of each tree node. The evaluation results show that the average number of memory accesses and the average memory usage in the proposed method have been reduced by 39\% and 87\%, respectively. Also, MBitCuts outperforms state-of-the-art tree-based algorithms by simultaneously achieving the best classification speed and the least memory consumption.},

abstract = {As a promising alternative to TCAM-based solutions for packet classification, FPGA has received increasing attention. Although extensive research has been conducted in this area, existing FPGA-based packet classifiers cannot satisfy the burgeoning needs from OpenFlow, which demands large-scale rule sets and frequent rule updates. As a recently proposed hardware-specific approach, TabTree avoids rule replication and supports dynamic rule update. However, it still faces problems of unbalanced rule subset partition, unevenly distributed subtrees and excessive TSS leaf nodes when implemented on FPGA. In this paper, we propose a hardware-friendly packet classification approach called KickTree, which is elaborated by considering hardware properties. To take advantage of intrinsic parallelism of FPGA, KickTree adopts multiple balanced decision trees which can run simultaneously. The bit selection is more flexible which breaks the restriction of rule subset. Moreover, each subset size is strictly limited, leading to bounded and evenly-distributed},

abstract = {The popular OpenFlow virtual switch Open vSwitch (OVS) uses a variant of Tuple Space Search (TSS) for packet classification. Although it is easy for rule updates, the lookup performance is poor. By introducing partial trees into TSS, the recently proposed CutTSS improves the lookup performance of TSS. However, it is challenging to replace TSS in OVS for two reasons: (1) the hand-tuned partitioning heuristics are rule-set dependent; (2) the complex and irregular data structures make it difficult to be integrated and maintained in real systems. To address these issues, we propose HybridTSS, a recursive TSS scheme for fast packet classification in OVS, which exploits three novel ideas: (1) the recursive partitioning based on reinforcement learning balances global rule partitions with low training complexity; (2) a hybrid TSS scheme combining coarse-grained and fine-grained tuples suppresses tuple explosion in TSS; (3) a heterogeneous search algorithm consisting of TSS and linear search adapts to characteristics of rules at different scales for fast lookups. Using ClassBench, we show that, while immune from the main drawbacks of CutTSS, HybridTSS retains the update performance of TSS, and achieves almost an order of magnitude higher lookup performance than TSS, making it an ideal packet classification algorithm for OVS.},

To achieve high throughput and low latency, state-of-the-art algorithms strive to fit the rule lookup data structures into on-die caches; however, they do not scale well with the number of rules.We present a novel approach, NuevoMatch, which improves the memory scaling of existing methods. A new data structure, Range Query Recursive Model Index (RQ-RMI), is the key component that enables NuevoMatch to replace most of the accesses to main memory with model inference computations. We describe an efficient training algorithm that guarantees the correctness of the RQ-RMI-based classification. The use of RQ-RMI allows the rules to be compressed into model weights that fit into the hardware cache. Further, it takes advantage of the growing support for fast neural network processing in modern CPUs, such as wide vector instructions, achieving a rate of tens of nanoseconds per lookup.Our evaluation using 500K multi-field rules from the standard ClassBench benchmark shows a geometric mean compression factor of 4.9x, 8x, and 82x, and average performance improvement of 2.4x, 2.6x, and 1.6x in throughput compared to CutSplit, NeuroCuts, and TupleMerge, all state-of-the-art algorithms1.},

ABSTRACT = {Packet classification based on rules of packet header fields is the key technology for enabling software-defined networking (SDN). Ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) is a widely used hardware for packet classification; however, commercially available TCAM chips have only limited storage. As the number of supported header fields in SDN increases, the number of supported rules in a TCAM chip is reduced. In this work, we present a novel scheme to enable packet classification using TCAM with entries that are narrower than rules by storing the most representative field of a ruleset in TCAM. Due to the fact that not all rules can be distinguished using one field, our scheme employs a TCAM-based multimatch packet classification technique to ensure correctness. We further develop approaches to reduce redundant TCAM accesses for multimatch packet classification. Although our scheme requires additional TCAM accesses, it supports packet classification upon long rules with narrow TCAM entries, and drastically reduces the required TCAM storage. Our experimental results show that our scheme requires a moderate number of additional TCAM accesses and consumes much less storage compared to the basic TCAM-based packet classification. Thus, it can provide the required scalability for long rules required by potential applications of SDN.},

abstract = {Publisher Summary
Network processors are generally configured with only a small amount of memory with limited access bandwidth. A key challenge is to design packet classification algorithms that can be implemented efficiently on network processor platforms. The design of such algorithms needs to exploit the structure and characteristics of packet classification rules. This chapter analyzes several databases of classification rules found in firewalls and derived their statistical properties. The rules found in access control lists (ACL) contain two types of fields, and these rules refer to many more network paths than applications. IP address pairs identify regions that overlap with one another. Only a small number of transport-level fields are sufficient to characterize ACLs of different sizes. Based on the findings, a hybrid, two-stage classification architecture is suggested.}

abstract = {Packet filters provide rules for classifying packets based on header fields. High speed packet classification has received much study. However, the twin problems of fast updates and fast conflict detection have not received much attention. A conflict occurs when two classifiers overlap, potentially creating ambiguity for packets that match both filters. For example, if Rule 1 specifies that all packets going to CNN be rate controlled and Rule 2 specifies that all packets coming from Walmart be given high priority, the rules conflict for traffic from Walmart to CNN. There has been prior work on efficient conflict detection for two-dimensional classifiers. However, the best known algorithm for conflict detection for general classifiers is the naive O(N2) algorithm of comparing each pair of rules for a conflict. In this paper, we describe an efficient and scalable conflict detection algorithm for the general case that is significantly faster. For example, for a database of 20000 rules, our algorithm is 40 times faster than the naive implementation. Even without considering conflicts, our algorithm also provides a packet classifier with fast updates and fast lookups that can be used for stateful packet filtering.}

abstract = {While the problem of high performance packet classification has received a great deal of attention in recent years, the research community has yet to develop algorithmic methods that can overcome the drawbacks of TCAM-based solutions. This paper introduces a hybrid approach, which partitions the filter set into subsets that are easy to search efficiently. The partitioning strategy groups filters that are close to one another in tuple space [10], which makes it possible to use information from single field lookups to limit the number of subsets that must be searched. We can trade-off running time against space consumption by adjusting the coarseness of the tuple space partition. We find that for two-dimensional filter sets, the method finds the best-matching filter with just four hash probes while limiting the memory space expansion factor to about 2. We also introduce a novel method for Longest Prefix Matching (LPM), which we use as a component of the overall packet classification algorithm. Our LPM method uses a small amount of on-chip memory to speedup the search of an off-chip data structure, but uses significantly less on-chip memory than earlier methods based on Bloom filters.},

abstract = {Present day routers typically employ monolithic operating systems which are not easily upgradable and extensible. With the rapid rate of protocol development it is becoming increasingly important to dynamically upgrade router software in an incremental fashion. We have designed and implemented a high performance, modular, extended integrated services router software architecture in the NetBSD operating system kernel. This architecture allows code modules, called plugins, to be dynamically added and configured at run time. One of the novel features of our design is the ability to bind different plugins to individual flows; this allows for distinct plugin implementations to seamlessly coexist in the same runtime environment. High performance is achieved through a carefully designed modular architecture; an innovative packet classification algorithm that is both powerful and highly efficient; and by caching that exploits the flow-like characteristics of Internet traffic. Compared to a monolithic best-effort kernel, our implementation requires an average increase in packet processing overhead of only 8\%, or 500 cycles/2.1ms per packet when running on a P6/233.},

abstract = {We introduce the first algorithm that we are aware of to employ Bloom filters for Longest Prefix Matching (LPM). The algorithm performs parallel queries on Bloom filters, an efficient data structure for membership queries, in order to determine address prefix membership in sets of prefixes sorted by prefix length. We show that use of this algorithm for Internet Protocol (IP) routing lookups results in a search engine providing better performance and scalability than TCAM-based approaches. The key feature of our technique is that the performance, as determined by the number of dependent memory accesses per lookup, can be held constant for longer address lengths or additional unique address prefix lengths in the forwarding table given that memory resources scale linearly with the number of prefixes in the forwarding table.Our approach is equally attractive for Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) which uses 128-bit destination addresses, four times longer than IPv4. We present a basic version of our approach along with optimizations leveraging previous advances in LPM algorithms. We also report results of performance simulations of our system using snapshots of IPv4 BGP tables and extend the results to IPv6. Using less than 2Mb of embedded RAM and a commodity SRAM device, our technique achieves average performance of one hash probe per lookup and a worst case of two hash probes and one array access per lookup.},

We describe how IP lookups can be made faster using a new technique called controlled prefix expansion. Controlled prefix expansion, together with optimization techniques based on dynamic programming, can be used to improve the speed of the best known IP lookup algorithms by at least a factor of two. When applied to trie search, our techniques provide a range of algorithms whose performance can be tuned.

Our actual experiments used 512 KB L2 cache to obtain a worst-case search time of 226 nsec, a worst-case worst case insert/delete time of 2.5 msec and an average insert/delete time of 4 usec. We also describe how our techniques can be used to improve the speed of binary search on prefix lengths to provide a scalable solution for IPv6.

It is compounded by increasing routing table sizes, increased traffic, higher-speed links, and the migration to 128-bit IPv6 addresses. We describe how IP lookups and updates can be made faster using a set of of transformation techniques. Our main technique, controlled prefix expansion, transforms a set of prefixes into an equivalent set with fewer prefix lengths. In addition, we use optimization techniques based on dynamic programming, and local transformations of data structures to improve cache behavior. When applied to trie search, our techniques provide a range of algorithms     (Expanded Tries) whose performance can be tuned. For example, using a processor with 1MB of L2 cache, search of the MaeEast database containing 38000 prefixes can be done in 3 L2 cache accesses. On a 300MHz Pentium II which takes 4 cycles for accessing the first word of the L2 cacheline, this algorithm has a worst-case search time of 180 nsec., a worst-case insert/delete time of 2.5 msec., and an average insert/delete time of 4 usec. Expanded tries provide faster search and faster insert/delete times than earlier lookup algirthms. When applied to Binary Search on Levels, our techniques improve worst-case search times by nearly a factor of 2 (using twice as much storage) for the MaeEast database. Our approach to algorithm design is based on measurements     using the VTune tool on a Pentium to obtain dynamic clock cycle counts. Our techniques also apply to similar address lookup problems in other network protocols.},

abstract = {Packet classification performs multidimensional point location upon fields in packet headers to categorize packets into multiple forwarding classes based on pre-defined rules. It plays an important role for the data plane of software-defined networking (SDN). Packet classification is also applied to support quality of service and network security. In this work, we propose an algorithm, Segregated Cross-producting, to improve the scalability of cross-producting in term of storage. Our algorithm starts by categorizing rules according to their length combinations, where the rules of the same length combination do not incur any storage penalty for cross-producting. Then, the algorithm selectively merges rules of different length combinations to improve the search performance. Our scheme is suitable for parallel implementation to further improve speed performance and can support real-time incremental updates. We extensively evaluate the performance of our scheme with rulesets of different sizes and characteristics. The experiment results show that our scheme can provide superior scalability for both speed and space performance.}

The collection of points is fixed once and for all and can be preprocessed. The box, on the other hand, constitutes a query that must be answered online. It is shown that on a pointer machine a query time of O(k + polylog(n)), where k is the number of points to be reported, can only be achieved at the expense of Ω(n(log n/log log n)d-1) storage. Interestingly, these bounds are optimal in the pointer machine model, but they can be improved (ever so slightly) on a random access machine. In a companion paper, we address the related problem of adding up weights assigned to the points in the query box.},

Specifically, we consider the following dominance search problem: Given a collection of n weighted points in d-space and a query point q, compute the cumulative weight of the points dominated (in all coordinates) by q. It is assumed that the weights are chosen in a commutative semigroup and that the query time measures only the number of arithmetic operations needed to compute the answer. It is proved that if m units of storage are available, then the query time is at least proportional to (log n/log(2m/n))d–*1 in both the worst and average cases. This lower bound is provably tight for m = Ω(n(log n) d–1+ϵ) and any fixed ϵ > 0. A lower bound of Ω(n/log log n)d) on the time required for executing n inserts and queries is also established.  —Author's Abstract},

The main goal of this paper is to demonstrate how data compression can benefit the networking community, by showing how to squeeze the IP Forwarding Information Base (FIB), the giant table consulted by IP routers to make forwarding decisions, into information-theoretical entropy bounds, with essentially zero cost on longest prefix match and FIB update. First, we adopt the state-of-the-art in compressed data structures, yielding a static entropy-compressed FIB representation with asymptotically optimal lookup. Then, we re-design the venerable prefix tree, used commonly for IP lookup for at least 20 years in IP routers, to also admit entropy bounds and support lookup in optimal time and update in nearly optimal time. Evaluations on a Linux kernel prototype indicate that our compressors encode a FIB comprising more than 440K prefixes to just about 100--400 KBytes of memory, with a threefold increase in lookup throughput and no penalty on FIB updates.},

abstract = {Traditionally, the Internet provides only a "best-effort" service, treating all packets going to the same destination equally. However, providing differentiated services for different users based on their quality requirements is increasingly becoming a demanding issue. For this, routers need to have the capability to distinguish and isolate traffic belonging to different flows. This ability to determine the flow each packet belongs to is called packet classification. Technology vendors are reluctant to support algorithmic solutions for classification due to their nondeterministic performance. Although content addressable memories (CAMs) are favoured by technology vendors due to their deterministic high-lookup rates, they suffer from the problems of high-power consumption and high-silicon cost. This paper provides a new algorithmic-architectural solution for packet classification that mixes CAMs with algorithms based on multilevel cutting of the classification space into smaller spaces. The provided solution utilizes the geometrical distribution of rules in the classification space. It provides the deterministic performance of CAMs, support for dynamic updates, and added flexibility for system designers.},

abstract = {A large body of research literature has focused on improving the performance of longest prefix match IP-lookup. More recently, embedded memory based architectures have been proposed, which delivers very high lookup and update throughput. These architectures often use a pipeline of embedded memories, where each stage stores a single or set of levels of the lookup trie. A stream of lookup requests are issued into the pipeline, one every cycle, in order to achieve high throughput. Most recently, Baboescu et al. [21] have proposed a novel architecture, which uses circular memory pipeline and dynamically maps parts of the lookup trie to different stages.In this paper we extend this approach with an architecture called Circular, Adaptive and Monotonic Pipeline (CAMP), which is based upon the key observation that circular pipeline allows decoupling the number of pipeline stages from the number of levels in the trie. This provides much more flexibility in mapping nodes of the lookup trie to the stages. The flexibility, in turn, improves the memory utilization and also reduces the total memory and power consumption. The flexibility comes at a cost however; since the requests are issued at an arbitrary stage, they may get blocked if their entry stage is busy. In an extreme case, a request may block for a time equal to the pipeline depth, which may severely affect the pipeline utilization. We show that fairly straightforward techniques can ensure nearly full utilization of the pipeline. These techniques, coupled with an adaptive mapping of trie nodes to the circular pipeline, create a pipelined architecture which can operate at high rates irrespective of the trie size.},

abstract = {Some of the fastest practical algorithms for IP route lookup are based on space-efficient encodings of multi-bit tries [1, 2]. Unfortunately, the time required by these algorithms grows in proportion to the address length, making them less attractive for IPv6. This paper describes and evaluates a new data structure called a shape-shifting trie, in which the data structure nodes correspond to arbitrarily shaped subtrees of the underlying binary trie for a given set of address prefixes. The ability to adapt the node shape to the trie reduces the number of nodes that must be accessed to perform a lookup, especially for tries with large sparse regions. We give a fast algorithmfor optimally dividing a trie into nodes so as to minimize the maximum lookup depth. We show that seven data structure accesses are suffi- cient for route tables with more than 150,000 IPv6 prefixes. This makes it possible to achieve wire-speed processing for OC192 link using a single QDRII SRAM chip.},

abstract="Packet classification involves --- given a set of rules --- finding the highest priority rule matching an incoming packet. When designing packet classification algorithms, three metrics need to be considered: query time, update time and storage requirements. The algorithms proposed to-date have been heuristics that exploit structure inherent in the classification rules, and/or trade off one or more metrics for others. In this paper, we describe two new simple dynamic classification algorithms, Heap-on-Trie or HoT and Binarysearchtree-on-Trie or BoT for general classifiers. The performance of these algorithms is considered in the worst-case, i.e., without assumptions about structure in the classification rules. They are also designed to perform well (though not necessarily the ``best'') in each of the metrics simultaneously.",
