# Introduction

Code in the `orig` directory and its subdirectories are "original"
versions of code that I copied from other places.  By "original" I
simply mean that I have not modified them from the version that I
found.


## Software from PClassEval project pages

The files in these directories were copied from TAR files that can be
found in pages linked from the PClassEval project pages:

As far as I know, they were written by Haoyu Song.  I do not find any
software license associated with them:

+ `song-bv`
+ `song-hicut`
+ `song-hypercut`
+ `song-rfc`
+ `song-tss`
+ `song-woo`
